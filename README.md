This project aims to ascertain whether customers in a specific telecom industry are likely to churn or not. I developed a Flask application for this purpose. The analysis revolves around telecom churn analysis, involving data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training data on various models.I employed decision tree classifier, Random Forest, and PCA for modeling. Among these, Random Forest yielded the highest accuracy, prompting its selection for the Flask application. 
The dataset utilized contains information on customers who have churned from the telecom company.
